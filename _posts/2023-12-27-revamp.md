title: Revamping my webpage
---

I have finally decided to revamp my previously webpage, which is almost non-existent. Thanks to Github Pages, giving my page a decent new look is not too difficult, even though I am illiterate at web development. A bit of knowledge in Markdown does help too. The template I use is [Reverie](https://reverie.pages.dev/). I chose this template partly because I subconsciously relate to the piano piece by Debussy, reimagined [here](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XuNP1Fqm4Sg) by Ramin Djawadi.

My plan in 2024 is to retrospectively create posts for various presentations made over the years, thus giving them a backstory, in addition to actually writing posts from time to time. Consider this the first one, even though 2023 hasn't ended (but almost).
