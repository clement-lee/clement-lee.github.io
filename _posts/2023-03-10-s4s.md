title: My experience with the RSS Statisticians for Society scheme
categories: [RSS, Charity]

I volunteered at the [Statisticians for Society](https://rss.org.uk/membership/volunteering-and-promoting/statisticians-for-society-initiative/) scheme by the RSS, who pairs its members with charities to work on their ... data. I was paired with [Freegle](https://www.ilovefreegle.org/), which is an online platform for giving away items, essentially a crossover of Ebay and charity shops. This [talk](/slides/s4s_20230310.pdf) sums up my work with Freegle so far.

A [case study](https://rss.org.uk/membership/volunteering-and-promoting/statisticians-for-society-initiative/) is also available on RSS's website.
