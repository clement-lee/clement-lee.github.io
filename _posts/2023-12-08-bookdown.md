title: Creating teaching materials with bookdown
categories: [Rmarkdown, Reproducibility, Teaching]

I have been quite crazy with [Rmarkdown](https://bookdown.org/yihui/rmarkdown-cookbook/) and its upgrade, [bookdown](https://bookdown.org/yihui/bookdown/). It has helped me create and convert accessible & reproducible teaching materials over the years. This [presentation](/slides/bookdown_20231208.html) is a summary of the conversion from LaTeX to Rmarkdown, essentially a reminder to myself in the future.

The main idea is that R code and results can be included or excluded by code chunk options, which can be parametrised in the commands via `rmarkdown::render()` or `bookdown::render_book()`. What is slightly trickier is doing the same for text and equations, as there's no default solution environment as far as I know. My workaround is to make them strings in R, then use the same trick with code chunk options and with `results = "asis"`. Experimenting with Python and [Quarto](https://quarto.org/) would be next.
