title: A presentation on networks model selection
categories: [Stochastic Block Model, Model Selection]

This [presentation](/slides/reading_group_20210310.html) is an extension of my [review paper](https://doi.org/10.1007/s41109-019-0232-2) on stochastic block models (SBMs). There is this ever-present issue of selecting the number of blocks (or groups) when applying an SBM. This presentation focuses on the approaches that use a criterion to select this number. Various criteria that existed then are:

1. Likelihood modularity  
2. Complete data log-likelihood  
3. Integrated complete data log-likelihood (ICL)  
4. Approximate ICL  
5. Observed data log-likelihood  
6. Approximate observed data log-likelihood  
7. Marginal log-likelihood  
8. Bayesian information criterion
