Being late to package developments, I wrote the package [crandep](https://cran.r-project.org/package=crandep), not only to capture the dependency network of CRAN packages, but also to analyse it and answer some questions:

1. Does the (in-)degree distribution of any hard dependencies (`Depends`, `Imports`, `LinkingTo`) follow the power law, partially or wholly?  
2. How do the nodes cluster?

An [elevator pitch](/slides/useR-elevator-pitch.html) was given at the useR! 2021 conference.
