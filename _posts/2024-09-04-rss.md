Thank you to Teresa Lee at the [Young Statisticians Section](https://rss.org.uk/membership/rss-groups-and-committees/sections/young-statisticians/) to invite me to present ([slides](https://clement-lee.github.io/slides/rss-20240904.html)) at the session "Getting your work to work" at the [RSS conference](https://rss.org.uk/training-events/conference-2024/). It's a good opportunity for me to consolidate what I have been doing regarding reproducibility so far, in my teaching, research, and the current role of [UKRN](https://www.ukrn.org/) local network leads.

As a testament (which I also showed in the presentation), I managed to reproduce my work from my [JASA paper](https://doi.org/10.1080/01621459.2019.1585358), but with two big big caveats:

1. `dplyr::summarise_all(<function name>)` has been deprecated, and I had to change it to e.g. `dplyr::summarise(dplyr::across(dplyr::everything(), <function name>))`, because I didn't use any package management e.g. renv, packrat, etc.
2. I used `rm(list = ls())` to "clean" the environment. Shame on me.

Good wake-up call. Let's learn from the mistakes.
