2025 is off to a good start. I will be working (again) with [Freegle](https://www.ilovefreegle.org/) to continue where we were last time when collaborating under the RSS [Statisticians for Society](https://rss.org.uk/membership/volunteering-and-promoting/statisticians-for-society-initiative/) scheme. I have previously made a [post](/s4s) about this. This time we've got funded by [ICMS KE Catalyst](https://icms.org.uk/news/new-ke-catalysts-humanity-announced)!
