A [taster lecture](/slides/stem_taster_20200624.pdf) was given to high school students who want to do STEM degrees in university. It was done virtually (of course) at the height of the pandemic and first lockdown, and I thought,  what better topic to talk about than epidemics? I didn't know how the students took it though, but there was at least a differential equation to work on.
