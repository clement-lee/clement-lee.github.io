Fresh off the press, the paper on mixture distribution for network degrees is now available [online](https://doi.org/10.1111/stan.12355) on Statistica Neerlandica! The presentations I have recently made at [Sunbelt Conference](/slides/sunbelt_20240630.html) and an [internal research day](/slides/research_day_20240710.html) are based on the same paper, but we have changed the title to hopefully make it more appealing to the network science community.

For anyone interested, my [R package](https://cran.r-project.org/package=crandep) provides the inference algorithms for fitting the mixture models. Unfortunately, some datasets cannot be accessed online the [KONECT project](http://konect.cc/) is no longer available, just when I included the open access statement in the paper. Talk about bad timing.
