Some Newcastle colleagues and I met some counterparts in Durham today to discuss teaching mathematics and statistics, digital materials and assessment, etc. I presented [the conversion of the teaching materials that I talked about](/slides/bookdown_20231208.html), this time in a slightly more interactive way. My focus was on making a sequence of small gains, in the spirit of Kaizen, but the main comment that caught me by surprise was that the use of bookdown might facilitate plagiarism, if those inheriting the converted materials have no idea where they originated from, which could be https://bookdown.org or an online repo.

To prepare for this presentation, I also gave the associated [GitHub repo](https://github.com/clement-lee/teaching-materials-template) a makeover. For each different kind of materials (standalone file, slides, notes), there is a subdirectory containing the source files and the generated documents, to illustrate the reproducibility.
